We tried to understand the concept of a marketplace and what blockchain technology was. We looked as different uses of blockchain technology
currently and how and why we might need it in the marketplace. We Brainstormed many usecases for vehicle data and we clusteres
those use cases as follows:

- UX
  - joy of driving
  - too many cars
- Efficiency of the car
  - maintenance
  - supply chain
  - traffic
  - regulations  
- User behavior
  - road rage
- Shared mobility
- Trust
  - data
  - safety
  - transparency
- Safety

We voted and decided that the use case for shared mobility was the most interesting given emerging trends. We
thought about fully autonomous vehicles and how the market would change due to this. Through Fords research we found that the
the entire market would change due to fully autonomous vehicles preventing individual car sales from being a primary source of revenue
for the company. We found the ride sharing prodivers like Chariot, Uber, and Lyft would be the primary automotive consumers and 
individual riders would provide data from their phones but the cars would have data which is currently owned by the OEM and insights from
the car usage could be useful for the OEM to share with the fleet managers.

#### Maintenance and the Blockchain

We stumbled across an interesting use case where the service needs of parts in a vehicle could be communicated with an OEM and
this could trigger a service request from the OEM enabling a stronger relationship to grow between the OEM and the fleet manager.
Instead of the OEM having an external service provider tell them when to schedule maintenance after so many miles driven, the OEM has 
a lot of data on the usage of the car and an analytics team and algorithms with understand performance and can make recommendations
to the ower of the vehicle about individual part performance and replacement/ function needs.
Service prodivers and part manufactueres are currenlty montiering part replcement on the blockchain to make sure that parts being
replced in a vehicle are not faulty parts and that those parts are of quality.
