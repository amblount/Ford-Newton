## Breif: Markets for Vehicle Data

##### How could blockchains help us crowdsource real driving data to improve autonomous vehicle systems?

<p>
  We know we need millions of miles of real driving data to create autonomous driving systems. TOday, companies either build their own vehicles and drive as much as they can (e.g. Google) or sell vehicles to end-users and passively capture the data (e.g. Tesla). The end creator of that information (the human driver) plays no part in this transaction, even though their information is being used to improve the overall system.

<p>
  We are interested in figuring out if connected cars that can capture relevant data for autonomous systems might also be able to participate in the data marketplace to share their data with AV system manuafacturers.

#### Prorotype to Build:

<p>
  Using a distributed ledger system, create a way for vehicles (or their drivers) to seamelssly and directly sell a simple set of data (like a camera or tire-slip data to help identify snow on the road) to another. Think a simple add on to an existing vehicle, that would enable it to collect data and participate in markets. This system should take into account..
  
  - the needs of the driver to preserve privacy, reap financial reward, and be securely compensated (think about why to use a blockchain for this)
  
  - the needs of the developer of assemble enough data to create a robust system (think about what data they need, how it should be transferred, and what triggers payments)
